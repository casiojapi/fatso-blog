> Technical research blog on zero-knowledge cryptography security, ZK proof system vulnerabilities, and privacy protocol exploits.

Published by Fat Solutions (https://fatsolutions.xyz), a zero-knowledge cryptography research and development team.

## About This Blog

This blog publishes in-depth technical analysis of zero-knowledge proof vulnerabilities, circuit bugs, proof system exploits, and privacy protocol security issues. It serves as a reference for ZK security researchers, auditors, protocol developers, and anyone working with zero-knowledge cryptography.

## Topics Covered

- ZK circuit vulnerabilities (under-constrained signals, missing bit-length checks, nondeterminism)
- Proof system exploits (broken Fiat-Shamir, verifier bugs, soundness collapse)
- Trusted setup failures (toxic waste leaks, parameter misconfiguration, Groth16 soundness breaks)
- STARK/SNARK field incompatibilities
- Governance attacks on privacy protocols
- Operational security failures in ZK systems

## Protocols Analyzed

Tornado Cash, Zcash, Polygon zkEVM, PSE/Scroll zkEVM, Aztec, ZKSync, Dark Forest, Veil Cash, FOOM Cash, Circom-Pairing, ZK Email

## Proof Systems Covered

Groth16, PLONK, Bulletproofs, STARKs, SNARKs, Halo2

## Languages and Tooling

Cairo, Noir, Circom, Halo2, Solidity
